Getting started in C 
1. Introduction 
The   purpose of this assignment   is to get familiar with   C   Language,   use   functions   and   array,   and   learn   how to   design a simple game with   a friendly   user   interface   using   C   Language.
2. Instructions 
You can   use   nano or any other   editor   to   write   your   C   code.

3. Steps: 
In this assignment, you will create a   simple Tic Tac Toe game   designed for   one   player   (against   the   computer). You will   need to create arrays and functions   to   complete this   program.

Once the   user enters the coordinates, the   program should   respond accordingly with   a   print   of   the   user’s   move and the computer’s   move. This should go on   until   a   winning   pattern   is   found.

After you complete the   program, copy the code from UNIX environment to Notepad in windows and upload the ‘C’ file to the Open Learning Faculty Member.
